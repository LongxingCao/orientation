Nearly optimal coverings of orientation space.

Here we give various sets of orientations with cover orientation space
nearly optimally.  These are suitable for searching orientation space
and for integrating over orientation (together with the provided
weights).

Given a set of N orientations, we define its covering radius, alpha, as
the maximum amount by which an arbitrary orientation needs to be rotated
to align it with the closest member of the set.  The coverage, c, is
defined as

	N(alpha - sin alpha)
    c = --------------------
		pi

A set of orientations is optimal if

* there are no other sets with the same under of elements with a
 smaller alpha (and c).

* all sets with a smaller number of elements have a larger alpha.

For any set of N orientations we can perform a Voronoi tesselatation of
orientation space, associating with each member of the set, q_i, all
orientations for which q_i is the closest orientation.  We define the
relative weight of q_i as

		 volume of Voronoi cell
    w_i = N ---------------------------------
	    total volume of orientation space

We can approximate an orientational average of f(q) with

    <f> = sum w_i f(q_i) / N

Assuming that the variation in f is bounded, we expect that, for a given
N, the error in this approximation to be minimized with an optimal set
of orientations.

Expressing the orientation as a unit quaternion or a pair of opposite
points on S^3, we see that this problem is just a 4-dimensional
generalization of the "Spherical Covering" problem.  See

    R. H. Hardin, N. J. A. Sloane and W. D. Smith
    Spherical Coverings
    http://www.research.att.com/~njas/coverings/

with the additional constraint that the points come as opposite pairs.
The formula for c above involves the "area" of a spherical cap on S^3.

We provide here "nearly" optimal sets of points.  Since our interest is
primarily on being able to general "good" sets at several values of N,
we generated most of these sets by placing a body-centered-cubic lattice
within the cells of a truncated-cubic tetracontaoctachoron (48-cell).

Here is the procedure.  Each cell of the 48-cell is a truncated cube.
Define the primary cell as

    p_0 = 1
    p_{i>0} < sqrt(2) - 1
    |p_1| + |p_2| + |p_2| < 1

the other cells are generated from this by the application of the
rotational symmetry group of the cube.

Place a body-centered-cubic lattice, with lattice spacing delta, within
the primary cell (including only points lies within the cell).  Thus we
take

   p_0 = 1
   [p_1, p_2, p_3] = [i, j, k] * delta/2

where [i, j, k] are either all even or all odd (to give a BCC lattice).
These points are then normalized with q = p / |p| to place them on S^3.

As delta is varied the number of points within the cell (N/24) varies.
For a given N, pick the delta with the smallest covering.  (To obtain
the sets given here, we systematicallly varied delta in steps of
0.00001.)  Discard any N for which there is a smaller N with a smaller
(or equal) alpha.

There are many ways in which we might imagine improving these sets.
Using a uniform lattice spacing sometimes improves the coverage (two
examples are included here).  One might offset the lattice or perturb
the points here the surface of the cells.  However because these
strategies make the search for good sets considerably more complex, the
simple procedure outlined above probably gives results which are "good
enough".


The format for each set is:

1 line containing
N alpha(degrees) c

N lines containing (i = 1..N)
q_0i q_1i q_2i q_3i w_i

c600v		 vertices of 600-cell
c600vc		 vertices and cells of 600-cell
c600vec		 vertices, edges, and cells of 600-cell
c48u1		 cell centers of 48-cell
c48u9
c48u27
c48u83
c48u157
c48u181

For each set, can obtain new sets by performing an arbitrary rotation of
R^4 via

    q'_i = r q_i s

where r and s are fixed (possibly random) unit quaternions.  The pre-
and post-multiplication allows all rotations of R^4 to be accessed; see

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation

One way of estimating the error in the numerical quadrature is to repeat
the calculation several times with the same set of points but choosing
different random r and s each time.

(Note that original sets possess symmetry that if q_i is a member of the
set then so is the inverse rotation q_i*.  The new sets q'_i do not have
this property, in general.)
